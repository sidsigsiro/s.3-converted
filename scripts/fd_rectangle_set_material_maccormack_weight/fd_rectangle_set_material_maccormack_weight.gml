	// two schemes. The result of a high MacCormack weight is that the material will have significantly
	// higher detail. In the case of material advection (as opposed to velocity advection) this is usually undesirable
	// and should be set to 0 or a low value.

	// MacCormack weight: A value between 0 and 1 for how much of the effect to be used.
